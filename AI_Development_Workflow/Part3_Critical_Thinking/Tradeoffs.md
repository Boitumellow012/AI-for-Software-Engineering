# Trade-offs

## Interpretability vs Accuracy
- Highly accurate models like deep learning can be “black boxes,” making it hard for clinicians to trust.
- Simpler models (e.g., decision trees) are more interpretable but may be less accurate.

## Limited Computational Resources Impact
- May require choosing lightweight models.
- Trade-off: simpler models might be less precise but faster and more deployable in constrained environments.
