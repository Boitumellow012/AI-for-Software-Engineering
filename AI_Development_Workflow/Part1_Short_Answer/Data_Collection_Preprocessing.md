# Data Collection & Preprocessing

## Data Sources
1. School enrollment and attendance records.
2. Student demographic and academic performance data.

## Potential Bias
- Underrepresentation of certain demographic groups (e.g., minority students) which could skew prediction accuracy.

## Preprocessing Steps
1. Handle missing data by imputing with mean or mode values.
2. Normalize numerical features like test scores for consistent scaling.
3. Encode categorical variables such as gender or course enrollment using one-hot encoding.
