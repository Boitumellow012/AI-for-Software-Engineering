# Evaluation & Deployment

## Evaluation Metrics
- Recall: critical to identify most at-risk students.
- F1-Score: balances precision and recall to measure overall prediction quality.

## Concept Drift
- Concept drift refers to changes in the data distribution over time that can degrade model performance.
- Monitoring: track prediction accuracy and data statistics post-deployment; retrain model when significant drift is detected.

## Technical Challenge
- Scalability: ensuring the system can handle increasing numbers of students and real-time data updates.
