# Model Development

## Model Choice
- Random Forest: chosen for its robustness to overfitting, ability to handle mixed data types, and interpretability.

## Data Splitting
- Training set: 70%
- Validation set: 15%
- Test set: 15%

## Hyperparameters to Tune
1. Number of trees (`n_estimators`): impacts model complexity and accuracy.
2. Maximum tree depth (`max_depth`): controls overfitting by limiting tree size.
