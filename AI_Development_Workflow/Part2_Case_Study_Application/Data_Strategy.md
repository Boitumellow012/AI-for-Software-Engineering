- Patient demographics

## Ethical Concerns
1. Patient privacy and data confidentiality.
2. Potential bias in data leading to unfair treatment.

## Preprocessing Pipeline

2. Feature engineering: create indicators like number of previous admissions.
3. Normalize numerical features such as age and lab test results.
